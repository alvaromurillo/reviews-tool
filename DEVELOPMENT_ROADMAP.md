### Implementation Considerations

**Rate Limiting:**
- Google Play: ~100 requests/hour
- App Store: ~50 requests/hour
- Implement exponential backoff

**User Agents:**
- Rotate realistic user agents
- Avoid bot detection

**Error Handling:**
- Graceful degradation
- Informative logging
- Automatic retries

## 🎯 Priority Use Cases

1. **Marketing:** Find positive reviews for landing pages
2. **Customer Support:** Identify reviews without developer response
3. **Analysis:** Sentiment analysis and competitor monitoring
